        details: "Gravity also termed as gravitation, is a force that occurs among all material objects in the universe. For any two objects or units having non-zero mass, the force of gravity has a tendency to attract them toward each other. The Universal Law of Gravitation says that: Every object in the universe has the property to attract every other object with a force which is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. ",
        formula: "F = GmMd⁻²",
        process: "The Force of Gravitation F , between two bodies / system of mass m and M , where d is the radius or distance between the two bodies and G is the constant of proportionality known as the universal gravitation constant ( 6.67 × 10⁻¹¹ Newton - meter² · kg⁻² ) , is equals to product of ( G , m and M ) divided by the ( d² ) . SI unit for gravitation force is Newton . SI unit for universal gravitational constant is Newton - meter² · Kg⁻² ",
        siunit: "G = Nm²/Kg²",
        dimension: "G = M⁻¹ L³ T⁻²"
